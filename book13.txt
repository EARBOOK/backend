ONE
Larry McCulloch was a survivor, no doubt about it. Say what you like 
about him, (oh and they did) but the one thing you could never do was deny 
his ability to worm his way out of trouble. In his sixty-seven years, Larry had 
been shot, (twice) stabbed, (thrice) and beaten to a pulp, (too numerous to 
mention) but had always come out the other side smelling of roses, no matter 
what the bastards had thrown at him.
He’d led a charmed life that was for sure, so how he’d come to find 
himself in this present company eluded him. Larry looked around at the three 
plain clothed officers he was sharing the car with as they drove through the 
rain and turned onto yet another dimly lit street. 
They were kids really, not one of them was over forty, and although he 
had only known them a matter of hours, he hated the lot of them already and 
certainly didn’t relish the fact that these three were his last line of defence 
against those who, most of whom he had once called friends, now wanted 
him very dead.
Lewis, who Larry had already taken a particular dislike to, was in the front 
passenger seat fumbling with a hand drawn map. The man was thirty five at 
most, and looked like a dishevelled accountant in his crumped cheap suit and 
badly combed dirty blond hair. Larry figured none of them had heard of a 
SAT NAV which didn’t bode well.7 
Lewis frowned at the makeshift map and absently ruffled his already 
messy mop of hair. “Ok Jeff, you want to take your next left,” he instructed 
Jeff, the driver who was barely into his twenties, but looked even younger, the 
kid nodded and obediently took the next turning.
Larry peered out of his side window at the urban decay as it passed by. 
“Hmm,” he said. “Dark deserted streets, that’s a good idea.”
Lewis craned his neck around. “Relax Larry, you’re with the professionals 
now. No more uniforms, we’re the real deal.”
